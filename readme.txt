# The "multhop_lora_simulator_version2_2023.m" file in the "Simulator Folder" contains the code for running the simulator.

# The results of the paper was generated using this simulator.

# To generate plots like the paper, please check the .m files given in the "Plot Code" folder.

# The simulator includes the following layers:

Application Layer: Generates and manages packets, including payload sizes and traffic patterns

Network Layer: Handles routing (relaying), node addressing, and path selection

Data Link Layer (MAC): Manages interference, collisions, and scheduling

Physical Layer: Models frequency, spreading factor, bandwidth, path loss, transmission power, current consumption, interference, receiver sensitivity, and transceiver behavior
